# Advanced Topics in I-O Psychology - Big Data Analytics

This repository houses many of the assignments, projects, and ancillary materials for a  course that was designed by my advisor, [Dr. Adam Meade](https://meade.wordpress.ncsu.edu/), covering concepts that are not usually reviewed in tradition IO methods.

## Course Objectives

With the proliferation of big data throughout organizations, psychologists, especially Industrial-Organizational psychologists, need to adapt their traditional analytics methods based on small samples and often experimental designs to make use of advanced analytic methods not typically seen in psychology.

This course is designed to (1) provide an overview of machine learning methods and principles; (2) compare and contrast empirically derived data exploration with thoery-based traditional approaches of data analysis; and (3) provide experience with using R for data analytic methods.
